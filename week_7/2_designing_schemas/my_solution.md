# U3.W7: Designing Schemas


#### I worked on this challenge by myself


## Release 0: Student Roster Schema
phase_0_unit_3/week7/img/students


## Release 1: One to Many Schema
<!-- display your image inline here -->
phase_0_unit_3/week7/img/one_to_many			

## Release 2: One to One Schema
<!-- display your image inline here -->
phase_0_unit_3/week7/img/one_to_one

## Release 3: Many to Many Schema
<!-- display your image inline here -->
phase_0_unit_3/week7/img/many_to_many

## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
connecting the user with her facebook and twitter account
<!-- display your one-to-one image inline here -->
phase_0_unit_3/week7/img/my_own_one
<!-- display your many-to-many image inline here -->
phase_0_unit_3/week7/img/my_own_many		

## Release 5: Reflection
It was really fun playing around with SQL Designer. 
And I found it easy to make a table and assign the type of the input.
I hope I could be better at this! s
